### Mini Project: Phone Store

This is a smaller project where I aimed to simulate a simple phone store interface with basic backend interaction. The idea was to practice working with localhost and understand how frontend communicates with backend to create dynamic content.

What I learned:

- How to work with localhost environment

- Using the Fetch API in JavaScript to send and receive data from the backend

- Dynamically creating product cards (order items) on the frontend based on data received

- Manipulating the DOM with JavaScript to create and insert HTML elements programmatically
